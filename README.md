# COVID-for-Ontario-Licensed-Child-Care

Under construction

Not sure where this will take me but whether you're a parent, caregiver, or interest party; COVID probably is a factor in deciding whether or not to send your child to child care.

Ontario publishes thier data here:
https://www.ontario.ca/page/covid-19-cases-schools-and-child-care-centres#section-0

Using Python I will attempt to build some visualizations using this data as the foundation.

Please do not accept the visualizations as the final truth, but rather as a tool to aid your further research in making informed decisions.
