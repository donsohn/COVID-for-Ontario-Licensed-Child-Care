# COVID-for-Ontario-Licensed-Child-Care

Under construction

Not sure where this will take me but whether you're a parent, caregiver, or interest party; COVID is likely a factor in your decision whether or not to send your child to child care.

Ontario publishes thier data here:
https://www.ontario.ca/page/covid-19-cases-schools-and-child-care-centres#section-0

Using Python I will attempt to build some visualizations using this data as the foundation but more specifically for Toronto region.

Please do not accept these visualizations as the final truth, but rather as a tool to aid you in further research, to ultimately make your own informed decision.
